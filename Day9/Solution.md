```SQL
-- This query selects the dates and a string containing merged products per customer for each day from the 'orders' table.

-- Selecting dates and merged products per customer for each day using STRING_AGG function
SELECT 
    dates, 
    STRING_AGG(CAST(product_id AS VARCHAR), ',') AS products -- Merging product_id values into a comma-separated string
FROM  
    orders 
GROUP BY 
    dates, customer_id 

UNION -- Union to include individual product_id values

SELECT 
    dates,
    CAST(product_id AS VARCHAR) -- Casting product_id as varchar
FROM 
    orders; -- Selecting from the 'orders' table

```

### Explanation:

This SQL query accomplishes the task of merging products per customer for each day and includes individual product IDs as well. Here's how it works step by step:

1. **Merging Products Per Customer for Each Day**:
   - The first part of the query uses the `STRING_AGG` function to merge `product_id` values into a comma-separated string for each combination of `dates` and `customer_id`.
   - It selects `dates` and the merged `products` column.
   - Groups the results by `dates` and `customer_id` to aggregate products per day for each customer.

2. **Including Individual Product IDs**:
   - The second part of the query includes individual `product_id` values for each date without merging.
   - It selects `dates` and individual `product_id` values.
   - This part ensures that individual product IDs are also included in the final output.

3. **Combining Results with UNION**:
   - The `UNION` operator is used to combine the results of both parts of the query.
   - This ensures that the final output includes both the merged product IDs and individual product IDs for each date.
