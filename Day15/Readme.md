### SQL Query:

```sql
-- Selecting the columns: friend1, friend2, and count of mutual friends
SELECT 
    f1.Friend1,
    f1.Friend2,
    COUNT(f2.Friend1) AS Mutual_Friends
-- From the Friends table aliased as f1
FROM 
    Friends f1
-- Left joining Friends table again, aliased as f2, to find mutual friends
LEFT JOIN 
    Friends f2 ON f1.Friend1 = f2.Friend1 AND f1.Friend2 != f2.Friend2
             OR f1.Friend1 = f2.Friend2 AND f1.Friend2 != f2.Friend1
-- Grouping the results by friend1 and friend2
GROUP BY 
    f1.Friend1,
    f1.Friend2
-- Ordering the results by friend1 and then friend2
ORDER BY 
    f1.Friend1,
    f1.Friend2;
```


### Explanation Step by Step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start by selecting data from the `Friends` table, aliased as `f1`.

2. **Joining the Table with Itself**:
   - We join the `Friends` table (`f1`) with itself (`f2`) to find mutual friends.
   - We match pairs where `Friend1` of `f1` is equal to either `Friend1` or `Friend2` of `f2`, and vice versa.
   - We ensure that `Friend2` of `f1` is not equal to `Friend2` of `f2`, to avoid counting friendships with the same person.
   - This step establishes connections between pairs of friends that might have mutual connections.

3. **Counting Mutual Friends**:
   - We count the occurrences of `Friend1` in `f2`, as it represents mutual friends.
   - The count provides the number of mutual friends for each pair of friends.

4. **Grouping and Ordering**:
   - Group the results by the pairs of friends (`Friend1` and `Friend2`).
   - Order the results alphabetically by `Friend1` and then `Friend2`.

By following these steps, the query produces a result set containing the number of mutual friends for each pair of friends in the `Friends` table.


here is example
Let's take the sample friend "Jason" from the given table and explain how the query works step by step:

### Sample Friend: "Jason"

1. **Initialization**:
   - We select data from the `Friends` table, aliased as `f1`.

2. **Joining the Table with Itself**:
   - We join the `Friends` table (`f1`) with itself (`f2`) to find mutual friends.
   - For the sample friend "Jason":
     - We find other pairs where "Jason" is involved.
     - This includes pairs like ('Jason', 'Mary'), ('Jason', 'Mike'), and ('Susan', 'Jason').
     - We're looking for connections where "Jason" is either the first friend (`Friend1`) or the second friend (`Friend2`) in the pairs.

3. **Counting Mutual Friends**:
   - We count the occurrences of `Friend1` in `f2`, as it represents mutual friends.
   - For "Jason", this count includes mutual friends from pairs like ('Jason', 'Mary'), ('Mike', 'Jason'), and ('Susan', 'Jason').
   - These counts will give us the number of mutual friends "Jason" has with each of his friends.

4. **Grouping and Ordering**:
   - We group the results by the pairs of friends (`Friend1` and `Friend2`).
   - In our case, we're grouping by "Jason" and his friends.
   - The results will be ordered alphabetically by `Friend1` and then `Friend2`.

### Conclusion:

By following these steps for the sample friend "Jason", the query will provide a result set showing the number of mutual friends "Jason" has with each of his friends. This explanation demonstrates how the query operates for a single friend, but it repeats this process for each friend in the `Friends` table, providing the overall count of mutual friends for each pair of friends.
